# Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Fuel Price Trends in Toronto


This project, Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Fuel Price Trends in Toronto, focuses on leveraging historical data to predict pump fuel prices in Toronto. The objective is to compare the performance of multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and KNN Regression, to determine the most accurate model for fuel price prediction. The project also aims to identify the key factors influencing fuel price trends.

Using real-world data from the Ontario Fuel Prices dataset, the analysis involves:

1. Cleaning and preprocessing the data to focus solely on Toronto.
2. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
3. Training and evaluating machine learning models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.
4. Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices to assess model accuracy and trends.
   
The insights from this project provide a comprehensive understanding of fuel price dynamics and help determine the most effective predictive model for future price forecasting.
