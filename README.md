# Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Fuel Price Trends in Toronto

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting pump fuel prices in Toronto using machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to utilize historical fuel price data from Ontario and apply different machine learning models to understand which variables most influence fuel price fluctuations and determine the best model for predicting future fuel prices accurately.

The dataset used in this project is publicly available from the Ontario government:

Dataset Source: Ontario Fuel Prices
Description: This dataset contains detailed records of fuel prices across various regions in Ontario, including data on pump prices, crude costs, taxes, wholesale margins, and retail margins. Our analysis focuses on fuel prices in Toronto, utilizing the historical trends and economic factors available within this dataset.
