# Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Fuel Price Trends in Toronto

This project, Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms for Analyzing Fuel Price Trends in Toronto, focuses on leveraging historical data to predict pump fuel prices in Toronto. The primary objective is to compare the performance of multiple machine learning models—Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and KNN Regression—to determine the most accurate model for fuel price prediction. The project also seeks to identify the key factors influencing fuel price trends.

Using real-world data from the Ontario Fuel Prices dataset, the analysis involves the following stages:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

   * Focused the dataset on Toronto fuel price data.
   * Handled missing values and transformed the data into a suitable format for analysis.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   * Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and relationships in the data using visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
   * Identified potential outliers and key trends in fuel price components.

3. Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation:

   * Trained and tested the following machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, KNN Regression
   * Evaluated the performance of these models using: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score
4. Results and Visualization:

   * Compared actual vs. predicted prices for each model.
   * Generated comprehensive visualizations to assess model accuracy and identify trends in predictions.
